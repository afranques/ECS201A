ECS 201A - Homework 3
=====================

Due: Monday, 13 November 2017 at 3:10 PM
----------------------------------------

Submission of your code and your report will be done through Canvas_.
See the Submission_ section below for more information.

.. _Canvas: https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/146759

*Please submit your report as a separate PDF, and not in the archive!*
Not only does this make things easier for me to grade, but I can give you feedback directly onto your report.

Overview
--------

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience optimizing code to increase its instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and to see the ILP limits of in-order processors.

We will again be using gem5.
However, for this assignment, we will use the ARM ISA, not x86.
The main reason we are using ARM (the ISA) is because ARM (the company) has provided an implementation of a high-performance in-order processor that is similar to one of their products.

Using ARM adds an extra level of complexity in compiling your code.
Instead of just running ``gcc`` or whatever compiler you like, you must cross-compile the application.
Cross-compiling means compiling for a different ISA than your host machine, since, odds are, nobody in class is using an ARM processor on their main computer.

I have already downloaded and set up a cross compiler for everyone to use on the CSIF machines.
You can access it at:

.. code-block:: sh

    /home2/jlp/gcc-linaro-5.4.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu

Setup
-----

Getting the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like last time, you need to download the code from the ``jlpteaching`` Github repository.
If you already added the repository as a remote, great!
Otherwise, go back to homework 2 and follow the directions there.

You should be able to simply checkout the new branch:

.. code-block:: sh

    git fetch jlpteaching
    git checkout hw3

The Test Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the new code, you'll find a test application: ``daxpy.cc``.
This file actually has three different test kernels: ``daxpy`` (double a\*x+y), ``daxsbxpxy`` (double a\*x^2+b\*x+x\*y), and a simple stencil.
I made ``daxsbxpxy`` up.

There are two implementations of each function: a naive version that is a simple for loop, and an "unrolled" version.
You will fill in the unrolled version with a high-ILP implementation.

The application runs all six functions one after another with ``m5_dump_reset_stats()`` between each function to isolate the performance.
Thus, you will have eight different stat dumps when running the program.

Compiling
~~~~~~~~~

Once you checkout the ``hw3`` branch, you can compile the ``daxpy`` program for ARM on the CSIF by using ``make``.
If you insist on using your own device, you can follow the `documentation on cross compiling from ARM`_. 
**Important**: If you set up the cross compiler on your own system, you must modify the Makefile to work on your system.
**Make sure you are using -O1 optimization for all compilation unless it is stated otherwise!!!**

You will have to recompile gem5 to use the ARM ISA.
To compile gem5 with the ARM ISA instead of x86, use the same command, but substitute ARM for x86 as below.
There is no need to specify the CPUs on the command line this time, since ARM defaults to using ``MinorCPU``.

Compile it with the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    scons build/ARM/gem5.opt -jX

where ``X`` in ``-jX`` is the number of cores in your machine, plus one.

.. _documentation on cross compiling from ARM: https://developer.arm.com/research/research-enablement/system-modeling

Running the Test Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the test program we are going to use the config files from the ARM research enablement package (see `ARM's website`__)
Thus, to run our application you can use the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/arm/starter_se.py daxpy --cpu=hpi

You may want to turn the above into a shell script.

This will run the application using the "HPI" (high-performance in-order) core.
You can find the configuration for the HPI core in ``configs/common/cores/arm/HPI.py``.
You may want to look at this file now.
You will need to modify it later.

Assignment
----------

Unroll the Loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each of the three experimental loops, apply the loop unrolling technique to (try to) reduce the hazards.
You may want to read more about loop unrolling on Wikipedia_, or watch these `good YouTube videos`_ from Georgia Tech's computer architecture course.
This was the first result when I Googled "loop unrolling."

Prove to yourself your unrolled loops are still getting the right answer.
In other words, make sure that you did not break the program when unrolling the loops.

Answer the following question in your report.

#. How did you prove that your unrolled loops are generating the correct results?

Once you have applied loop unrolling to the functions, run the application and measure the following for each function: CPI, time, and instructions.
**Note: Do not use the sim_insts statistic at the top of the statistics file**.
Instead use the committedInsts statistic from the CPU.

Also, be careful to look at the correct statistics dump.
The stats.txt file will have a number of different dumps so make sure you are looking at the dump for the function you care about.
There are also dumps for the initialization and cleanup at the end that should be ignored.

Answer the following question in your report.

2. Does loop unrolling provide an improvement? Answer for each function. What kind of hazard does loop unrolling decrease?

3. How many times should you unroll the loops? Is it the same for each loop? What happens if you don't unroll enough or unroll too much?

.. _earlier:

Increase the Core Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, modify ``HPI.py`` to have more SIMD/floating point units, so you can do more floating point operations in parallel and decrease the CPI.
You will want to modify ``configs/common/cores/arm/HPI.py``.
Specifically, you need to change the ``HPI_FUPool`` class to have more functional units.
You can duplicate ``HPI_FloatSimdFU()`` an additional three times *at the end* of the ``funcUnits`` list.

Re-run the application and observe any differences in execution characteristics.

Answer the following question in your report.

3. What effects does increasing the hardware have on both the unrolled and non-unrolled functions? What hazard does adding more hardware decrease?

Optimize the Loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, further modify your unrolled loops to try to further decrease the CPI.
It may be helpful to look at the generated assembly code while you are making these optimizations.
For this, you can use ``objdump``.
However, you will have to use the version that comes with the cross compiler, not the version that is default on the system (which only supports the host platform, x86).

I have installed the cross compiler version on the CSIF at the following location:

.. code-block:: sh

    /home2/jlp/gcc-linaro-5.4.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin

You will probably want to use ``objdump -dC daxpy``.
The ``-d`` option disassembles to convert from machine code to assembly, and the ``-C`` option "demangles" the names of functions so they are more readable.
You can find more information about ``objdump`` either by looking at the ``man`` page (``man objdump``) or Googling.

Again, once you get the ``objdump`` command working, you may want to turn it into a shell script.

`Another video from the Georgia Tech class`_ provides a good overview of how to get lower CPI by rearranging instructions.
You can also use techniques like software pipelining (from the Rau paper) and explained more clearly on wiki_.

.. _wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_pipelining

Answer the following question in your report.

4. How did you further optimize each function? Did your optimizations change the behavior as expected (e.g., improve performance, lower CPI)?

.. _Another video from the Georgia Tech class: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nx0ZCg5D9g

Use the Compiler to Optimize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify the Makefile to use the ``-O3`` option for GCC instead of ``-O1``.
This tells the compiler to use the highest level of optimizations.

You now have four different versions of each of the functions.

 - Unoptimized simple loops
 - Hand-optimized unrolled loops
 - GCC-optimized simple loops
 - GCC-optimized hand-optimized unrolled loops

Answer the following question in your report.

5. Compare all four versions of the functions on whatever metrics you deem appropriate. Also, discuss the trade-offs in your effort as a programmer.

In this assignment, we were executing very simple loops. Most programs are much more complicated, even the inner-loop kernels. Given this, answer the following question in your report.

6. Do you think it's ever worth hand-optimizing your code, or do you think the compiler optimizations are good enough?

If you use proprietary compilers, such as Intel's compiler for Intel machines, you will see better optimized code than what you saw in this assignment.

Extra Credit
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MinorCPU, which is the model that the HPI core is based on, is a very flexible CPU model.
All of the parameters for the HPI CPU can be found in the ``HPI.py`` file that we modified earlier_.

Can you modify these parameters (specifically in the ``HPI`` class) to achieve even higher performance and lower CPI for the loops?
You can choose to concentrate on only one version of the loops out of the four versions above.

Answer the following question in your report.

7. How did you modify the hardware? Was it effective?
